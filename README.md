# pandas-challenge
In this challenge, we were tasked to analyze the academic performance of students in a school district. The data came in two different CSV files.

In my analysis, I used Python and Pandas:

1. I created a district-wide summary calculating totals such as Total Budget, Total Students, Average Math and Reading Scores, Passing Rates, etc.
2. I created a dataframe of similar calculations but grouped by School to see which schools were performing the best and the worst.
3. I created tables calculating Average Math Scores and Average Reading Scores per school per grade.
4. I created a table to show the Average Math Score, Average Reading Score and Passing Rates based on School Budget which was binned into predetermined ranges.
5. I created a table similar to the one above but based on School Size (number of students) and another based on School Type (Charter School or District School).
6. I wrote a summary description of the academic trends I observed and next actionable steps or studies that could be looked into to improve academic performance.
