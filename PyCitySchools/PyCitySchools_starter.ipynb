In the top schools, the passing rates for Math and Reading are similar, at less than 5% difference between them and both at very high rates. However in the bottom schools, the % Passing Math rates are much lower than the % Passing Reading Rates, around 10%-15% lower with the % Passing Math in the 60s. This shows that the Math Scores have a lot of room for improvement. If we focused on improving the Math Scores of the bottom performing schools, it could greatly improve their overall passing rates. \n",

We could investigate some of the expenses in the budget that may be correlated with this decline.\n"
